# Week 1: Project Work – Decide on a Project

DUE: August 17.

*_Goal: By the end of this course, each student will have completed a project that contains:_*

- _published written narrative published via Github pages or other_
- _at least one data visualization_
- _Github repository with annotated code_
- _A &quot;recipe&quot; for how to replicate the story_
- _Links to and/or copies of all the data you used_


*_Describe:_*

- _What is the story structure?
- _Where is the nut graph?_
- _Use of anecdotes_
- _Is it a story or a report?_
- _News value – magnitude, oddity?_
- _What was the main number?_
- _List of all the comparisons_
- _List of all non-data sources (basically reverse fact-check)_

*_Pitch:_*

- _Can it be localized and/or updated?_
- _How likely can you get the data by August 31?_
- _What is your key new question? Your hunch?_
- _Who is the audience? What have they already seen?_
- _What will we know at the end of the story that we don&#39;t know now?_
- _Do we think that someone is being hurt by this?_
- _What is the potential for action or reform following the story?_
- _What do you already know about this topic? Do you already have human sources, either detached experts or actors in the drama?_
- _Map it on the quadrants (we will do this as a class)_

*We will do these together in class on the first day of class:*
